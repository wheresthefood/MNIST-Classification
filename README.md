# MNIST-Classification
Various Classifiers for MNIST Dataset

MNIST.ipynb is a notebook just playing around and getting a perceptron classifier to work well.  Numpy and Matplolib are the only needed libraries.

You can find an explanation to the above file at https://www.zswarth.com/blog/creating-a-perceptron-classifier-for-mnist-dataset/ 

perceptron_object.py is the work from the ipythn notbook put together neatly in a single object so it can be used later.

train_MNIST is a CSV of the MNIST data.
